 A hidden folder `.git` is created. This is where Git stores commit history, branches, staging area, etc. The directory becomes a repository. You can now use commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git status` etc.

> git add .                 - stage files 
> git reset HEAD readme.md - unstage the staged file  
> git checkout -- readme.md - bring it to last commit in ur local branch (sameas undo)

REMOTE REPO Commands
--------------------
To push my local Workspace folder to Remote repo
1. do  git init and commit ur code to local repo
2. create a remote repo naming same as ur local repo name at GitHub.com
3. Form VS code,
 git remote add origin https://github.com/tbharathi12-ship-it/Bucks2bar         -link ur local repo to remote repo
git branch -M main    name ur current local branch as 'main'  (even if named as something else, rename to 'main' forcibly with parm -M)
git push -u origin main           -u upstream link ur local branch to remote branch, push the local branch main into remote repo Origin.

pull remote into local with comparing diff before pull
------------------------------------------------------------
1. fetch into remote tracking branches
git fetch origin  (same as get fetch origin main)
- fetches main into remote tracking branch (local copy of whats in remote) 
git fetch -  fetches all branches from remote (origin) into remote tracking branch
2. compare the diff
git status - to know ur main is how many commits behind the remote main (origin/main )
or, u can also see the files and differences under'graph' double clicking the files
or  git diff origin/main (same as git diff origin/main main)
3.merge into local
  git merge origin/main

ORIGIN means remote repo
origin/main means remote-tracking branch

so the commands goes like this.
git fetch origin   main  
git merge origin/main main 
git diff origin/main main  
git pull origin main
